# SPINS tutorial extension
These are the scripts necessary for running Parts 2 and 3 of the [SPINS tutorial](https://wiki.math.uwaterloo.ca/fluidswiki/index.php?title=SPINS_Tutorial) on the fluids wiki. See full instructions there.

This tutorial is intended to introduce you to the matlab driver scripts and `spins_refinement.m` script, so you can start using them in your own simulations.
